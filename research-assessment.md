# Research Project Assessment

**This assessment is for the final research project only.** Use the `assessment.md` file for all mini-projects.


## Instructions

Before submitting your research project draft for grading, confirm:

1. The manuscript .qmd for your project is in the root directory and knits to .pdf without error.
2. The knitted .pdf of your draft is in the root directory, with the same filename as the .qmd.
3. This `research-assessment.md` file is in the root directory of your project repo.
4. Dr. Dowling and your section TA are collaborators on your GitHub repo with permissions to pull/push.

To complete this assessment:

1. Complete the basic information section and AI statement. 
2. Confirm all links are correct and accessible
3. Check off all objectives you are attempting to demonstrate
    1. To earn 30 points you must demonstrate each objective. However, you do not need to attempt all objectives with each draft if your goal is to build the project over time.
    2. If the objective is demonstrated somewhere other than the .qmd, add a note in the grader comments section for where to find it (e.g., "see `data-cleaning.R` lines 20-30").
4. Optionally, complete the reflection section, which may earn engagement points.

## Overall requirements

Overall requirements for the research project are as follows:

1. The project must be a research project. It must provide background on a research topic, ask at least one research question, use data to attempt to answer that question, report the results of the data analysis, and interpret the results in the context of the research question.
2. The project must be contained in a github repository that follows git best practices and includes all necessary files to run the project from start to finish, including:
    1. The .qmd file for the manuscript
    2. All data files used in the project
    3. All scripts used in the project
    4. A README.md file & .gitignore file
3. The project must be reproducible -- a reader should be able to clone the repo and run the .qmd from start to finish without error. The .qmd file should include:
    1. A YAML header with all fields necessary for an APA manuscript
    2. Setup source chunks that load libraries, read in data, set chunk options, set seed, etc.
    3. Minimally, an IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), though it may be more complex
    4. Integration of markdown and code chunks throughout, following best practices for using code chunks
    5. Figures and tables rendered in code chunks
    6. Inline R code & references to render data-dependent text
    7. At least 1 descriptive analysis and 1 hypothesis test, either in code chunks or sourced scripts
    8. Frequent and informative code comments throughout
4. The .qmd file should knit/render to an APA7 formatted manuscript with one click and no errors. The knitted manuscript should include:
    1. A title page with title, author, and institutional affiliation
    2. An abstract (this may be minimal, but should exist)
    3. Narrative text comprising a complete research report
    4. APA7 references, both in-text citations and a References page
    5. Publication-ready figures (2+) and tables (1+)
    6. Results of all analyses presented in-text (and where appropriate, in tables), with no raw R output; where possible, all text should be data-dependent and rendered with inline R code
    7. Quarto generated references to all figures and tables
    8. Statistical analyses and figures interpreted in narrative text
5. The .qmd should render a .pdf identical to the .pdf you submit for grading


## Assessment

The final project must demonstrate each of 30 the course learning objectives, each worth 1 point. 

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

Refer to the website for general tips on meeting these objectives and an FAQ.

### GitHub and R Studio

1.  Create and maintain a repo with sensible organization and naming conventions

    1.  All folder and file names are informative
    2.  Uses relative paths correctly
    3.  Does not have duplicate/redundant elements

        -   [x] Objective attempt

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: Giving you the point, but note that your readme does not use markdown headings correctly. You should not add text styling (like bold or italics) to headings; the point of headings is that it is styled automatically by markdown.

3.  integrate a GitHub repo with an R studio project, including .gitignore file

    1.  All scripts run and all notebooks render if the repo is cloned to another location
    2.  .gitingore comprehensively excludes unnecessary, private, and very large files and are commented appropriately

        -   Grader comments:

4.  effectively use version control

    1.  Used frequent, informative commit messages

        1. If packages other than the "class packages" listed on the resources page are used, code to install/require them is included *and commented out*
        2. When a reader opts-in to installing packages by uncommenting the code, it runs without errors 
    2. Uses more than one function to install/load/require packages (including those used in commented code)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: 
            1. ~~Use more than 1 function to install/require/load packages; functions that (may) install something on your reader’s machine should be commented out, then those packages loaded with library() (not commented out)~~
            2. ~~Refer to the d2mr resources page for a list of the packages you can load without a commented out install line.~~
            
            I had a commented out code for using the require() function as an alternative to calling packages with an explanation of the differences.
            I have also added commented out the code to install all the packages I loaded
        
6.  Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

    1. Uses all three types of operators
    2. Uses multiple operators in data transformation pipelines and/or inline R code

7.  Parse and define functions and arguments

    1. Defines at least one function with at least one argument in code chunks or sourced scripts
    2. User-defined function(s) run(s) without error and produces expected output in at least 2 contexts

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

8.  Parse and write conditional statements and/or loops

    1. Uses conditional in multiple contexts, including dplyr pipelines
    2. Uses multiple types of conditional/loop functions (e.g., `if_else()`, `case_when()`, `for`, `while`) (need at least 2)

        -   [x] Objective attempt 
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            1. ~~I see `where()` in your data cleaning .R script but no others~~
            
            I have also added others (if_else and case_when) in my data cleaning script and manuscript document.

9.  Use `readr` functions to read in and write out data

    1. Reads in data from at least one source in code chunk or sourced script
    2. Writes out intermediate and/or final datasets in code chunks or sourced scripts
    3. Uses only relative paths that run without error when repo is cloned

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: Your use of main-data-cleaning.R is a little odd. 
            1. ~~You read in a file and write out to the same file, which is generally not a good idea, since you can lose original data this way, and scripts won't work on processed data the same way they would have worked on raw data.~~
            2. ~~You don't need to do a whole read-in/write-out thing in a soucred script. The .R script you have now is really a stand-alone script. It doesn't need to be run every time the .qmd is knit. You should just have that run when you need to update data, then have the .qmd read in the data from the file you wrote out to.~~
            I have rectified this to export intermediate data files in the quarto document instead of in the sourced R script.
            
10. Use `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions to transform data

    1. Uses at least 3 unique `dplyr` functions
    2. Uses at least 1 `tidyr` function in a data transformation pipeline
    3. Combines `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions in a data transformation pipeline

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

11. Use `stringr` functions to work with string variables

    1. Uses at least 2 unique `stringr` functions 
    2. Uses `stringr` functions in a data transformation pipeline

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

12. Use `forcats` functions to work with factor variables

    1. Uses at least 2 unique `forcats` functions or one function in 2 unique contexts (with different purposes)
    2. Uses `forcats` functions in a data transformation pipeline
    - NOTE: Though they are base R functions, `factor()` and `levels()` can be used to meet this objective as long as they are used in a way that demonstrates the same skills as `forcats` functions, which should involve including optional arguments

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: 

### Data visualization with ggplot2

    2. At least one plot is multi-variable

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

14. Use dynamic aesthetics to group data

    1. Uses at least 2 unique data-mapped `aes()` arguments (e.g., color, shape, size) to group data in a plot in one or multiple plots

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        
15. Use facets to create parallel plots

    1. EITHER:
      1. Uses both `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` in two different plots *or*
      2. Uses facets with at least one plot using at least two optional arguments (e.g., modifying the number of rows and columns, using free vs fixed scales, etc.)
    2. Combines facets with other dynamic grouping aesthetics
      1. If data only includes 1 sensible grouping variable, it may be used for both the faceting and grouping aes.  

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
        
16. Create publication-quality plots using `theme` and `labs` layers

    1. Plots have informative titles, axis labels, and legends
    2. Fonts are stylized professionally and legibly (e.g., adjusted size/angle/justification)
    3. Variables and labels display in plain English (e.g., "Age (years)" not "child_age_yrs"
    4. Uses at least 1 static aesthetic (e.g., color, shape, size) that improves visual clarity without mapping to data

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: These are great!! I love that you figured out how to use Quarto for subplots. I usually go to the patchwork package for that, but some others have said that isn't working correctly with apaquarto for them. This is a great alternative!

### Data analysis

17. Perform simple descriptive analyses with multiple data types

    1. Calculates summary/descriptive statistics for at least 1 numeric variable (e.g., mean, standard deviation) 
    2. Calculates summary/descriptive statistics for at least 1 non-numeric variable (e.g., frequencies, proportions)
    3. Presents results in narrative text, table, or plot
    - NOTE: This objective may be met with only numeric or non-numeric summaries if they are sufficiently complex (at Dr. Dowling's discretion)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

18. Perform simple hypothesis testing analyses for multiple data types

    3. Discriminates between informative and non-informative statistics and presents only the former in narrative text
    4. Uses dynamic inline R code to render data-dependent text

        -   [x] Objective attempt

    1. Cites at least 3 sources in-text
    2. Uses at least 2 citation forms (e.g., (Author, Year), Author (Year), etc.)
    3. May use `cite_r()` to cite R and R packages

        -   [x] Objective attempt

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: ~~for apa formatting it needs to be called "References"~~

### Notebooks and code chunks

22. Create and effectively use code chunks following best practices

    1.  Uses informative names/labels
    2.  Includes frequent, informative comments
    3.  Follows the "1-chunk-1-thing" rule
    4.  Chunks are distributed throughout the manuscript, sensibly placed near the text they support

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: ~~it will require substantially more than 2 chunks to demonstrate the best practices above~~
        
23. Use code chunks to set up a quarto document

    1. Sources at least 1 .R script and/or reads in necessary data
    2. Loads packages in at least 1 code chunk
    3. Sets preferences/options in at least 1 code chunk
    4. Organizes setup chunks sensibly

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: ~~see comment above about read data and sourced scripts; the readin (or source) should be a setup chunk at the beginning of the document~~
        
24. Render publication-quality tables, figures, and images from code chunks

    1. Produces at least 1 table or image with a caption
    2. Produces at least 1 figure/plot with a markdown caption (title) and note
    3. Captions are informative, complete, and render correctly
    4. All tables and figures are referenced in the narrative text (e.g., Figure 1)
    5. References render without error and link to the correct table/figure in pdf/html output
    - NOTE: Ideally your table(s) should be produced in APA7 style, but this is not a strict requirement. At a minimum, they should render as formatted tables (not raw output), have readable and correctly formatted text (e.g., column headers should be capitalized and in plain english, not literal variable names), and the table must be dynamically referenced in the text.

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:
            1. Raw output. seems like there's a problem in the chunk tbl-demographics-sumstats. The table does render, but at the point in the text where the chunk occurs there is raw message output
        I added the note to the covariate table instead as it was more useful.

25. Execute descriptive and inferential analyses in code chunks

    1. At least 1 code chunk executes a descriptive analysis (e.g., `summary()`, `table()`)
    2. At least 1 code chunk executes a hypothesis test (e.g., `t.test()`, `chisq.test()`)
    3. Results are presented in narrative text, table, or plot
    4. Results are not displayed as raw R output
    5. Chunks are organized sensibly and appear near the text they support

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:


### R Markdown and Quarto

26. Create and maintain a quarto document YAML header
    
    1. Includes all necessary metadata, output options, and formatting options necessary to render an APA styled document (or other specified style if appropriate for the project)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: ~~you've got everything except an abstract. once you fill that in, you'll meet this objective.~~
        
27. Use quarto R Markdown to compose an academic manuscript

    1. Uses at least 2 unique text styles (e.g., bold, italics, code)
    2. Uses at least 2 unique header levels
    3. Includes at least 1 list
    4. Includes at least 1 footnote
    - NOTE: This is going to be one of the most flexible objectives to demonstrate.  You need to demonstrate a range of markdown skills and use them to make a readable, informative manuscript. Hitting the four points above should do that, but you can use your judgment about what kind of markdown features will best serve your project. No matter what, you should use markdown to follow APA7 guidelines.

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: nice pandoc table!

28. Use inline R variables to replace static text

    1. Replaces static text with inline R references in at least 3 unique numeric contexts
    2. Replaces static text with inline R references in at least 1 character context
    3. Ideally, uses inline R references for *all* data-dependent text

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:

29. Run inline R functions to render dynamic data-dependent text

    1. Uses inline R functions to render at least 3 unique data-dependent text outputs (e.g., performs rounding, calculates means, subtracts one list length from another, etc. -- inline rather than in a code chunk)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: Fulfilling this counts for 28 also
        
30. Use `knitr` and quarto to produce an APA7 formatted 1-click PDF manuscript, just need separate instances

    1. Produces a PDF output that is formatted in APA7 style
    2. PDF includes all necessary elements (e.g., title page, abstract, body, references)
    3. PDF renders without error and includes all text, tables, and figures
    4. No additional steps are needed (e.g., finding data, determining necessary packages to install and load, running unsourced scripts, correcting aboslute paths)

        -   [x] Objective attempt
        -   [x] Objective met
        -   Grader comments:        
            1. Level 1 headings are reserved for # Abstract, # Methods, # Results, # Discussion, # References, and # Appendix.
            2. In APA7, there is no heading before the introduction.
            3. Do not number sections or subsections
            4. To get this point you'll need to include sufficient narrative text in all sections

   

## Reflection (Optional)

Optionally (for engagement points) write a brief reflection about your work on this project. You can use this space to answer the following questions, but feel free to ignore these questions and write about whatever you think is most important.

- What was the most challenging aspect of this project?
- What was the most rewarding aspect of this project?
- What would you do differently if you were to start over?
- What did you learn from this project that you will carry forward to future projects?
- What are you most proud of in this project?

The most fulfilling part of the project for me was being able to produce professional-looking and visually pleasing figures and tables which complement the narrative text, and being able to weave it all together in a single document.
This was also likely the most complicated and frustrating part since the various possible ways to customise the figures and tables also meant more opportunities for error, and also certain features of certain packages were not compatible with apaquarto so a lot of trial-and-error and finetuning was required.
For example, the texreg function could not generate a quarto referenced table with output: asis under apaquarto, but texreg was superior to other table packages for handling more complex regressions like one I ran, so I had to resort to paste the raw latex output from the code into the markdown portion of the quarto document each time I made changes.
Another issue was with adding to apa-quarto notes to figures and tables with subsections.
The final major one was with the automatically formatted figure and table captions by apaquarto which clashed the output from certain table packages (e.g. overlapping with spanning header from gtsummary).
However, going through all these issues and finding solutions definitely helped me to improve my coding skills and whether I like it or not, is basically the bread and butter of coding so I am glad for the experience.
The ability to produce these visualisations will definitely be a great help in my research moving forward.
Other good learning points was using in-line R code to render dynamic text which changes with the data, and learning LaTeX math syntax.

Alternatively/additionally in mind some of the suggested ways to earn engagement points, and expand on this (or other aspects of your project) in your reflection:

- Creating many figures and tables, or particularly complex or creative ones
- Impressively thoughtful and thorough narrative writing in your literature review or discussion section
- Employing sophisticated statistical techniques in your analysis
- Making excellent use of markdown features to create a polished final product
- Having a maximally reproducible and dynamic manuscript
- Fully committing to best practices for version control and GitHub integration/organization




## Grading

All final projects are graded by Dr. Dowling. You will see your grade on Canvas separated into two categories: objective points and engagement points.

-   **Objective points:** 29/30
-   **Engagement points:** 10/10
-   **Total points:** 39/40

**Comments:** 

Final: Excellent job, Aspen! This is nearly flawless, exactly what I want to see from a final project. I'm really impressed with how much you were able to add in your efforts to find workaround for problems. It's annoying to have to mess with combining markdown and latex, but you figured it out and it looks great! I also noticed that you built a pandoc table and correctly labeled and cross-referenced it, which is something we spent about 10 seconds on in class. Really nice work!

Nice work! See comments above for details about how to get the points you missed. In general, once you actually add the content itself it will be easier to demonstrate the objectives.
